<h1>Oils</h1>
<p style="text-align:left">Incorporating essential and carrier oils into your hair regimine can have many benefits.
<br>
Oils are known to be a great way to moisturize your locks.<br>
<br>
Carrier oils are lightweight oils that can be used with essential oils in order to carry moisture to your hair. <br>Carrier oils can be used in order to penetrate the hair shaft with moisture, or on top of a moisturizer in order to seal moisture in.<br><br>
Essential oils are more potent than their carrier friends. <br>Essential oils are known to be very concentrated and you only need a few drops. They are not used to seal in moisture but each have their own benefits. </p>
