<h1>Oils</h1>
<p style="text-align:left">Incorporating essential and carrier oils into your hair regimine can have many benefits.
<br>
Oils are known to be a great way to moisturize your locks. Adding oils to your favorite products can greatly enhance their mositurizing benefits as well as other benefits.<br>
<br>
Many products claim to contail different oils but a quick look at the ingredients section on the label will show you how little this may be.<br>
We also want to take this time to remind you to always carefully examine the ingredients of any products placed in your hair, everythhing is not beneficial!
<br>
Natural / Vegan products marketed towards muli-cultural hair tends to have higher amounts of oils included.
<br>
Even still, adding oils to your product will show a great difference!
<br>
<br>
There are two different types of oils used as natural hair remedies: Carrier and Essential oils.
<br>
Carrier oils are lightweight oils that can be used with essential oils in order to carry moisture to your hair. <br>Carrier oils can be used in order to penetrate the hair shaft with moisture, or on top of a moisturizer in order to seal moisture in.<br>
Even though carrier oils can be used in conjuction with Essential oils many prefer to use them alone. <br>
Carrier oils are usually derived from some sort of vegetable or seed and odorless, they are not concentrated as essential oils and can be great moisturizers and sealers.
<br>
<br>
Essential oils are more potent than their carrier friends. <br>Essential oils are known to be very concentrated and you only need a few drops. They are not used to seal in moisture but each have their own benefits. 
<br>
These types of oils are usually derived from plants and have strong smells, they even work for aroma therapy and steaming.
<br>
Due to the concentrated nature of essential oils they should not be used alone. Best practice would be to dilute your essential oil into a carrier oil or another product.
