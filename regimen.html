<h1>Healthy Hair Regimen</h1>
Creating and maintaining a solid hair regimen is a very important part to maintaining healthy natural hair. The upkeep of natural hair is already difficult, without taking the right measures you may be left with dry brittle hair. <br>We are here to help you understand what a hair regimen is, as well as the benefits of adopting healthy hair habits. <br>
A hair regimen can be broken down by months, weeks, days. Each increment allowing you to decide how often you want to take certain steps with your hair. <br> A good hair regimen will help in the aid of retaining length. Setting goals for yourself; adding and reducing products and methods to as they best work for your hair is important.<br> Below we have a sample hair regimen, by no means should this act as a set in stone instruction guide for you, but it may help you to determine how you would like to set your own hair regimen up for what works best for you.

<h2 style="text-align:left">Sample Hair Regimen </h2>
<h3 style="text-align:left">Yearly </h3>
Trim – 2x a year <br>
Straighten 2x a year <br>

<h3 style="text-align:left">Monthly </h3>
PreePoo 2x a month <br>
Protein treatment 1x a month <br>
Clarifying Shampoo – 1x a month. <br>

<h3 style="text-align:left">Weekly </h3>
Shampoo wash 1x a week <br>
Co-Wash 2x a week <br>
Deep Condition 2x a week <br>

<h3 style="text-align:left">Nightly </h3>

<br>
<br>
Certain parts of your hair regimen may change as you see fit. For example washing your hair twice week may work for the warmer months but may start to cause breakage during the colder months. <br>
When you notice this type of negative change to your hair it means that it may be time to adjust your hair regimen a little. <br>
Your hair regimen may also change depending on the style in your hair. If you decide to protective style your hair for 6 months you will have to adjust your hair regimen to accommodate your protective style. <br> You may also decide to incorporate these styles into your hair regimen. <br> Let’s say you decide to do a low maintenance style once a week but want to straighten your hair once a month. Your hair regimen can be built to meet your hair and goal needs.<br> 
Products can also be incorporated and adjusted within your hair regimen. For example, let’s say you decide to wash with your favorite cleansing shampoo on Monday but follow up with your favorite moisturizing shampoo on Wednesday. <br>
You will be building efficient hair regimen's for the seasons in no time.
