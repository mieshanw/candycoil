<h1>Hair Types</h1>
There are many topics in the natural hair community in which naturalista's can not agree on, hair typing just happens to be one of those topics. <br>
But either way; we at Candycoil are here to ensure you understand the different types of hair types, as well as the terminology, look, feel, and how to determine your own hair type<br>
Hair typing is deemed as touchy topic due to the bias and discrimination that tighter hair textures are subjected to by hair care companies, the media, and other natural hair community members<br>
We understand why some may choose to not aknowledge hair typing but we believe that knowing your hair type can help you in selecting the products that work best for you on your natural hair care journyey. <br>
Hair types include Type 2, Type, 3 and Type 4 hair. Each number representing the texture of the hair :wavy, curly, coarse and then divded by letter (a,b,c) to represent the behaviour / feel. <br>
Many women find that their hair includes multiple hair types. It is not uncommon for your hair to have different hair types in certain sections<br>
Some woman find that the back of their hair is Type 4 while the front is type 3. This should not concern you<br>
It is important to understand your hair and how it grows, it is possible that your different hair types may be due to heat damage, head damage is not healthy.
