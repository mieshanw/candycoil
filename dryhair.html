<h2>Pree-Poo</h2>
You shampoo your hair in order to clean out the built up dirt and particles on your scalp and hair follicles. Even though shampooing has many benefits for the hair shampooing too often can also be detremintal. The pre poo method allows you to still cleanse your hair while also adding moisture o it. Instead of washing your hair with shampoo try washing it with your favorite moisturizing conditioner. You will notice the instant slip that it gives your hair. Limit your pre-poo to once a week for the best benefits, pre-pooing too often can also cause your hair to weaken.
