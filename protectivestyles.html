<h1>Protective Styling</h1>
<p style="text-align:left">
	Hair styles that require little to no heat such as braid outs, twist outs, and wash and go's are essential to a healthy hair regimine. <br>Even though these styles are healthy, the daily manipulation that they require can still add stress to your hair causing damage. <br>
	In order to give your hair a break from manipulation you should consider protective styling. <br>
	Protective styles are those which do not require you to manipulate your hair daily. In most cases your hair will be braided into/underneath the style

<p><h2>Braids/Twists:</h2>
<br>
African braiding / twist styles have been used by women for years in order to protect their hair. <br>
Using synthetic hair to braid into your own can be very beneficial to your hair. It reduces the daily maintence your hair would normally endure from daily styling.<br>
This style allows you access to your scalp in order to continue your wash/ moisturize sessions. You should still keep your hair clean while in this style<br>
When getting the styles done to your hair you have to be really careful, done wrong this type of style could cause breakage. <br>
Breakage to the hairline / edges section of the hair due to these styles is more common than it should be<br>
To ensure breakage does not happen make sure the person  installing this style for you does not make the braids tighter than they should be<br>
<br>
<h2>Wigs</h2>
<br>
Wigs are another great protective style. Using wigs allows you the convenience of removing the wig at night, during washes, and when moisturizing<br>
You still have full access to your hair to continue your hair regimine as normal, which is awesome!<br>
You can also style wigs however you choose, some wigs come pre-texured, wigs with human hair allow you to straighten and curl them as you wish. <br>
Adding heat to the wig to style it means you no longer have to put heat on your natural hair!<br>
<h2>Sew Ins</h2>
<br>
Sew ins are another great option for protecting your hair. Like wigs, the use of sew in takes away from the heat you would use on your own hair to style<br>
With human hair sew in you can straighten, curl, and style your sew in. A few sew in will protect ALL of your hair underneath, every strand is protected<br>
A partial sew in usually has a section of your natural hair left out (leave out) in order to make the style loook more realistic. <br>
You should make sure you are still washing your scalp when you have a sew in, this process is more tedious. <br>
After washing make sure your hair and scalp underneath is fully dry, you don't want mold!
